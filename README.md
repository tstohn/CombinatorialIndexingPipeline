# SingleCellGenomeTools
Some simple tools to process fastq-files of nucleotide tagged antibody reads for single cell protein measurements.

# Important Tools:
  - Mapping of a barcode pattern to fastq-reads
  - Generating a singleCell * ABCount matrix for those mapped reads
  
# Get started:

  `make install`
 - Have a look in the Makefile for how to use tool
