# SingleCellGenomeTools
Some simple tools to process fastq-files of nucleotide tagged antibody reads for single cell protein measurements.

# Important Tools:
  - Mapping of a barcode pattern to fastq-reads: *parser*
  - Generating a singleCell * ABCount matrix for those mapped reads: *processing*
  
# Get started:

  `make install`
  `make parser`
  `make processing`
 - Have a look in the Makefile for how to use tool
